Unity - Easing Library Visualisation
==================================

![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/IvmoeeY.png)

This project provides a front end visualisation to a group of 40 easing equations as easy to understand graphs with real-time animated markers to illustrate the motion. You can change the view from a single graph to all the graphs as well as displaying a column of drawers ( right side of image below ) that as you roll-over with the mouse will ease in or out to see the motion in action.

It contains a comprehensive easing class containing 10 different easing equations with 4 variations of each ( out, in, out-in, in-out ) based on the work of Robert Penner.
